Objective:
•	The dataset contained information on 3 million used cars is taken from Kaggle. The dataset contains information on 426K cars. The goal of the analysis is to understand what factors make a car more or less expensive, and to provide recommendations to the client—a used car dealership—as to what consumers value in a used car.

The code includes:
•	Load and clean the data
•	Create visualizations
•	Train three different models
•	Performance metrics for each model
•	Display feature importance
•	Provide summary statistics

The output includes:
•	Visualizations of key relationships
•	Performance metrics for each model
•	Feature importance rankings
•	Summary statistics of the dataset

Analysis to share with client—a used car dealership— as to what consumers value in a used car includes:

Vehicle Age and Condition
•	Newer vehicles have higher prices
•	Vehicles in excellent condition can sell more than those in fair condition

Mileage Impact
•	Lower mileage vehicles are most desirable
•	Price typically drops for every 50,000 miles on the odometer
•	High-mileage vehicles see significant price reductions

Brand Value and Type
•	Luxury brands maintain higher resale values
•	SUVs show stronger value retention
•	Japanese brands maintain steady resale values
•	American brands offer good value for price-conscious buyers

Next Steps for Implementation:
•	Regular market analysis to stay current with pricing trends
